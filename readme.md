### What is Hello API

Hello API is a **starter** providing the common functionalities required to build modern API-Centric Application. 

It uses the best frameworks, packages, tools and conventions to deliver one of the best PHP API starters.

`Why!?` Because setting up an API from scratch everytime is time consuming. 
Hello API gives you the core features of robust API's, so you can focus on the business logic of your App instead.


### Why API-Centric Apps

Today weâ€™re living in a digital era, where almost everything is connected to the Internet.

Building cross-devices applications is becoming a must. And to do it, you need APIs (Application Programing Interfaces).

Web developers are used to serve HTML pages directly from the Backend. However, this traditional method has many disadvantages nowadays.

API's can serve anything and everything (Mobile Apps, Web Apps, Smart TVs, Smart Watches,...).
As well as, it can be exposed to the world allowing developers to interact with your Application and help growing your business.

API-Centric Apps allows Frontend (Web + Mobile) and Backend developers to work on their codes in parallel. After the Frontend Apps are ready they get attached to the Backend (API-Centric) code to start functioning. This leads to zero decoupling between the Frontend and the Backend code and also removes the dependencies. The API documentation acts as the contract between both sides during the development life cycle of all the Apps.
